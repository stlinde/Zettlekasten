# On the Importance of SICP
The book by Abelson and Sussman *"Structure and Interpretations of Computer Programming"* keeps showing up in most of the blogs, videos and books I read on computer programming.
This is probably a testament to the importance of the book.
I've read some of it, but not thoroughly enough.
This must be prioritized, and take as long as needed, as it seems to be of paramount importance.

I read once, cannot remember where, that reading the book might be a large undertaking, and therefore should be done over several iterations.
The recommended reading order were:
1. Read the book from cover to cover, without taking notes or running code. Just focusing on understanding.
2. Read the book and take notes, run code.
3. Read the book and try to implement some of the code and concepts in other languages.
