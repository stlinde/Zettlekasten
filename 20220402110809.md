Only about pure coding.

1. Browsing the source is almost always faster than finding answers on StackOverflow.
2. In many cases, what you are working on does not have an answer on the initernet.
   That usually means the problem is hard or important. Or both.
3. Delete as much code as you can.
4. Syntactic sugar is usually bad.
5. Simple is hard.
6. Have a wide variety of tools and know which ones to use for the job.
7. Know the internals of the most used ones like `git` and `bash`.
8. Build your own tools for repeated workflows.
   There is nothing faster than using a tool you made yourself.
9. Only learn from the best. Not all fo the best practices are worth emulating verbatim, but is is a good start.
10. If it looks ugly, it is most likely a terrible mistake.
11. If you have to write a comment that is not a docstring, it should probably be refactored.
    Every new line of comments increases this probability.
12. If you don't understand how your program runs in production, you don't understand the program itself.
    In my experience, the best engineers know how their program works in every environment.
13. The above rule applies to the build pipeline as well.
14. Use other people's code religiously.
15. Corallary: Most code out there is terrible. Sometimes it is easier to write a better version yourself.
16. A rough rule of thumb: never take a direct dependency on a small library that you could easily rewrite or a large library that should have been small.
17. Know when to break the rules. For rules like "don't repeat yourself", sometimes a little repetition is better than a bit of dependency.
18. Organizing your code into modules, packages, and functions is important. Knowing where API boundaries will materialize is an art.
19. Pick the most efficient tool most of the time, but also pick what you know. Is Arch Linux the most efficient operating system for the modern developer? For me it is, but for most, probably not. Should you use acme? Only if you are Rob Pike.
20. Avoid cyclomatic complexity. Novice coders don't even know that they have tangled the dependency graph until it is too late. 
21. Avoid nesting conditionals deeply. Have commmon sense about your conditional test and naming convention. 
22. Name variables correctly.
23. While rare, sometimes it is a problem with the compiler. Otherwise, it is always the DNS. 
24. Use esoteric language features sparingly, but use them when you're supposed to, for that is the point.
25. Technology does not diffuse equally.
    For example, there is a lot that frontend developers could learn from low-level engineers (especially now that everything is compiled).
    Likewise, there are UX and usability features that JavaScript developers could teach engineers.
26. As a result, different kinds of engineers look at the world differently.
27. Some programmers are 10x more efficient than others.
28. There is no correlation between being a 10x developer and a 10x employee.
29. Good APIs are easy to use and hard to misuse.
30. The configuration cycle goes from hardcoded values to environment variables, to CLI flags, to a configuration file, to a templated configuration file, to a DSL, to a generic bash script, and back to hardcoded values.
31. All layers of abstraction are malleable. If you run into a fundamental wall, sometimes the answer is down a layer of abstraction. You aren't confined to the surface.
