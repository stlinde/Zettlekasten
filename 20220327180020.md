# Machine Learning and MLOps Roadmap - Learning MLOps in 16-20 Week Plan
From YT vid: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vh6Zj5QLU4) 

The size of the code running the machine learning model, is very small in comparison to the entire MLOps pipeline.
Google showed this in the paper **Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems**.
