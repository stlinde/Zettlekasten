# Programming/ Database Query Language
A cool project to taken on would be to write a custom database/ database querying language that would make querying financial time series data much easier for quants and data scientists.

Inspiration from: [Build Your Own Distributed Database with Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzcx4HaCQo)

Also see PrometheusIO with their PromQL for time-series computations: [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/)
