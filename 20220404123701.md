Building an interpreter for most of the Scheme dialect of Lisp using Python3.
The goal is to demonstrate, as concisely and simply as possible, what Alan Kay called ["Maxwell's Equations of Software"](http://www.righto.com/2008/07/maxwells-equations-of-software-examined.html).

Yegge describes 8 problems that can be solved with compilers [here](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rich-programmer-food.html).

## Syntax and Semantics of Scheme Programs
The *syntax* of a language is the arrangement of characters to form correct statements or expressions.
The *semantics* is the meaning of those statements or expressions.

If we think from the perspective of the parser, the parser is written to transform the source code into some other form that is useful later on in compilation.
The syntax of a language therefore is meaningful in the sense that it must have a given structure for the parser to understand it.
The parser analyses the patterns of the source code given by the syntax to be able to correctly read and transform it.

Scheme syntax is simple:
* Scheme programs consist solely of expressions. There is no statement/expression distinction.
* Numbers and symbols are called *atomic expressions*; they cannot be broken into pieces. In scheme operators such as `+` and `>` are symbols too, and are treated the same way as fx `fn`. 
* Everything else is a `list expression`: a "(" followed by zero or more expressions, follows by a ")". The first element of the list determines what it means:
    * A list starting with a keyword, e.g. `(if ...)`, is a special form; the meaning depends on the keyword.
    * A list starting with a non-keyword, e.g. `(fn ...)`, is a function call.

The beauty of Lisp is that the full language only needs 5 keywords and 8 syntactic forms.

## What a Language Interpreter Does
A language interpreter has two parts:
1. **Parsing**: The parsing component takes an input in the form of a sequence of characters, verifies it according to the *syntactic rules* of the language, and translates the program into an internal representation.
   In a simple interpreter the internal representation is a tree structure (often called an *abstract syntax tree*) that closely mirrors the nested structure of statements or expresssions in the program.
   In a language translator called a *compiler* there is often a series of internal representations, starting with an abstrac syntax tree, and progressing to a sequence of instructions that can be directly executed by the compiler.
   The Lispy parser is implemented with the function parse.
2. **Execution**: The internal representation is then processed according to the `semantic rules` of the language, thereby carrying out the compilation.
   Lispy's execution function is called `eval` (note this shadows Python's built-in function of the same name).

The interpretation process is then: program -> parse -> abstract-syntax-tree -> eval -> result.

## Parsing: `parse`, `tokenize`, and `read_from_tokens`
Parsing is traditionally separated into two parts: *lexical analysis*, in which the input character string is broken up into a sequence of *tokens*, and *syntactic analysis*, in which the tokens are assembled into an abstract syntax tree.
