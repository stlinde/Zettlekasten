# RWXROB - Beginner Boost Day 3: Understand the Linux Approach
The UNIX philosophy is to build minimal software and build increasingly complex software from simple pieces.

## How Does Linux Work?
Linux runs on the Linux kernel, created by Linus Torvalds.
Linux, is able to run on anything. 
The kernel is in charge of coordinating all the hardware and software thet works with the CPU.

The filesystem is the most important part of understanding Linux.
In Linux everything is a file.
See for example the battery status, which is a file in "/sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/capacity".
One of the reasons why everything is a file is that it is easy to combine several pieces of software as well as interacting with the computer.
This is a core part of the UNIX philosophy.

A process is something that runs on a computer.
Everything on the computer is being run as a process with a parent.
THus, every process is a child process of the init process of the operating system.
The operating systems primary job is to handle processes and the kernel. 
Understanding Linux is in large parts about understanding processes and files. 

Kubernetes is to a large degree an abstraction of an operating system.
