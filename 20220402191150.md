Long form answer to the question:
'*Question to all the side project machines that I follow (with much respect: what framework/ setup/ infrastructure/ tools do you use to push ideas to MVP so quickly?*'

**SEE** [dotlink.co]{dotlink.co} **for Linus' more technical blog**.

Side project is always some mixture of learning something new, fixing some problem I have in my life, or making something that i wish existed in the world, but doesn't.

I try to remember and write down ideas when they come up in conversation or in the shower, and remember to check back on that list whenever I have some free cycles in my life. 

Start when the motivation is high.
When you first have the idea, you have more motivation to work on the project than you will for a while, so start immediately.

## Picking Out Obstacles From My Workflow
After getting started immediately, the next trick that has helped me become the most productive in the last year has been to consciously remove obstacles from my side project workflow.
Below is a common set of obstacles, that now take only minutes to remove:


Used to take hours to get everything set up to deploy a project.
Use [surge.sh]{https://surge.sh/} for static deploys.
Use [vercel]{https://vercel.com/} for serverless deployments.
Custom server infrastructure on DigitalOcean for more heavyweight apps and services.

Use a consisten set of small tools, and know it well.
Some people use side projects to learn a galaxy of different tools and frameworks and libraries.
I don't really work that way, and I've come to use a really small  set of tools and libraries for all of my projects.
As a benefit of using a consistent set of tools, I've come to know all the tools I use very well.
Use Vim and Tmux for text editing and working in the command line.
Use Chrome Developer Tools for web development.
`telnet`, `curl`, `dig`, and `whois` for troubleshooting network issues.
Adobe XD for UI prototyping and design, when needed.

This is also one of the reasons I enjoy working with tools I write myself, rather than using other heavyweight libraries or languages -  if something is broken, I can just dive into the source code of the framework or language I'm using and figure out exactly what is going on, because I wrote it.

## Embrace the rough prototype
The first working version of *anything* is *rough*.

## Make it easy to iterate
I've been learning to place a greater emphasis on easy maintenance and iteration.
In a word, this means making
