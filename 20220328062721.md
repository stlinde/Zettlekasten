# RWXROB Beginner's Boost, Day 8 - Build Up Container with Software

## Understand Container States and Storage
When you call `docker run -it -h boost --name boost ubuntu` the `ubuntu` image is downloaded from the Docker servers.
This image is what will run in the container.
Docker makes a new instance of the ubuntu image and this is what will run in the container.
When you exit the container, the container state is saved.
That is, everything that you have done within the container is saved.

Using `docker commit` on a stopped ocntainer you can turn the container into an image.
This can be stored as a file or push it to Docker.

It is not good practice to keep projects or code that is valuable in only the saved docker container. 
Rather, this should be pushed to a GitHub repository to ensure that the work done is safe.

A dockerfile is a way to make an image without making an image commit.

## Manage Software Packages from the Command Line
`unminimize` takes the container from the minimal version and makes in into a full-fledged version.
That is it rebuilds all the documentation needed.
