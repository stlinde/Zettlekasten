Method that will keep all the good stuff in your brain.

## My Mistake in the Beginning
Wathcing countless hours of videos, taking copious amounts of notes, trying to remember everything.
Over time, realized that we forget these things.

## Repetition Over Time
What you should for each topic:
* Watch a couple of ours of videos on the topic, to get the main idea.
* Implement the algorithms and data structures.
* Make flash cards for important things I should remembewr about the topic.
* Move on to the next topic.
* Review the flash cards when you have time.
* After a few days, watch another video on the topic, perhaps 30 mins or so.
* After another week, watch a video on about the topic, maybe same video or shorter one.
* Keep reviewing flash cards.

The thing to notice here is the repetition.
Go back through all notes and put them into flash cards. Many flash cards.

The important point is: review a topic over several time intervals.
It will continue to reinforce and remind you, and you won't forget it.
The time interval can get longer over time.
