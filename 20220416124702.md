# Using Transformers in my Master's Thesis
Reading through some of George Hotz ai-notebooks I got the idea of how transformer models can be used in my Master's thesis.

The goal is to forecast one-step ahead daily volatilty (or realized variance). Thus the granularity of the individual minutes are probably too much to input into a regular econometric model.
I could however encode each day using transformers.
