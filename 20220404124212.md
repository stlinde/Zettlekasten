 The quote of Alan Kay:
 > Yes, that was the big revalation to me when I was in graduate school - when I finally understood that the half page of code on the bottom of page 13 of the Lisp 1.5. manual was Lisp in itself. These were "Maxwell's Equations of Software!".

What Kay refers to as the "Maxwell's Equations of Software" is the universal Lisp function `evalquote` that can evaluate any function.

```M-expression
evalquote[fn;x] = apply[fn;x;NIL]

; where 
apply[fn;x;a]  =
    [atom[fn] -> [eq[fn;CAR] -> caar[x];
                 eq[fn;CDR] -> cdar[x];
                 eq[fn;CONS] -> cons[car[x];cadr[x]];
                 eq[fn;ATOM] -> atom[car[x]];
                 eq[fn;EQ] -> eq[car[x];cadr[x]];
                 T -> apply[eval[fn;a];x;a]];
    eq[car[fn];LAMBDA] -> eval[caddr[fn];pairlis[cadr[fn];x;a]];
    eq[car[fn];LABEL] -> apply[caddr[fn];x;cons[cons[cadr[fn];
                              caddr[fn]];a]]]
eval[e;a] = [atom[e] -> cdr[assoc[e;a]];
    atom[car[e]] ->
     [eq[car[e],QUOTE] -> cadr[e];
     eq[car[e];COND] -> evcon[cdr[e];a];
     T -> apply[car[e];evlis[cdr[e];a];a]];
     T -> apply[car[e];evlis[cdr[e];a];a]]

evcon[c;a] = [eval[caar[c];a] -> eval[cadar[c];a];
    T -> evcon[cdr[c];a]]

evlis[m;a] = [null[m] -> NIL;
      T -> cons[eval[car[m];a];evlis[cdr[m];a]]]
```

The above code is defined in a meta-language (M-expressions), which can straightforwardly be translated into S-expressions.
Funtions in M-expressions use square brackets and have arguments separated by semicolons.
M-expression conditionals are of the form `[predicate -> value; predicate -> value; ...]`.
M-expression `label` is analogous to `defun` or `define`.

The point of all this is that M-expressions are the code that operates on the S-expression data, but the M-expression meta-language and S-expression data actually conincides.
Thus, code and data are the same thing in Lisp, and a half-page of code is sufficient to define a basic Lisp interpreter in Lisp given a few premitives (`car`, `cdr`, `cons`, `eq`, `atom`).

`apply` takes a function and argument.
`eval` acts on a form.
`apply` implements `CDR`, `CONS`, `CAR`, `ATOM` and `EQ` in terms of primitives.
It implements `LAMBDA` by pairing up the variables and arguments and passing them to `eval`.
It implements `LABEL` (which defines a function) by adding the function name and definition to the association list.
