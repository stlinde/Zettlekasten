# How does one set up a simple blog on GitHub pages? 
Through the functionality of GitHub pages I am able to set up a website controlled from a Github repository.
The recommended way to start the blog is to use Jekyll (ruby based template), it just seems super bloated.

The goal of the blog is just to have a simple interface to share thoughts and ideas.
The functionality that it should have, is the following:
* Simple and minimal layout. Default page is a list of posts or the last post.
* An about page -> with contact info.
* Perhaps a projects page. 
* Ability to write blog posts in markdown from vim cli.
* Ability to publish using git commit from cli.
