# Just RTFM as Major Method to Learn Kubernetes
For taking the Kubernetes certification rwxrob's strategy is to really understand the material from Kubernetes that is allowed on the exam.

1. Read the actual contents from Kubernetes.
    * <https://kubernetes.io/docs> 
    * <https://github.com/kubernetes/>
    * <https://kubernetes.io/blog>

2. Use *real* Kubernetes Instances
    * Use `kind` for local Kubernetes. Single node kubernetes cluster that is used to test the Kubernetes itself.
    * Use Ansible, Helm, Istio for real hardwarem (raspberry pis, old computers, etc.).
    * Use a local network attached storage device.
    * NOT going to use `micok8s`.
3. Consider Kubernetes the Hard Way by Kelsey Hightower.
