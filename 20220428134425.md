# Kevin Kotz√© - Volatility Models

Volatility is a critical metric in the *value-at-risk* calculation and is one of the key variables in options pricing and asset allocation models.
In addition, portfolio allocation measures such as the Markowitz mean-variance framework also depend on volatility, so a better measure of this statistic would lead to more efficient allocation of capital

Volatility is not directly observable in practice, we are only able to characterize various aspects or types of volatility.

In what follows, we discuss the advantages and weaknesses of each of the main classes of volatility models, before we consider a few applications of these models.

## 1 - Characteristics of Volatility
Volatility has a number of characteristics that are present in many asset returns:
* Volatility is usually high in certain periods and low in others (volatility clustering).
* Volatility evolves over time in a continuous manner, where volatility jumps are rare.
* Volatility does not diverge to infinity, as we note it varies within some fixed range. This may indicate that the volatility may be stationary.
* Volatility seems to react differently to a big price increase and a big price drop with the latter having a greater impact. Asymmetric effect due to leverage. 

The EGARCH and TGARCH models were developed to capture the asymmetric effects in volatility.

To measure the daily volatility of a particular asset that is quoted on a financial exchange we observe: 
1. The daily return for each trading day. 
2. Tick-by-tic data for intra-day transactions and quotes.
3. The prices of options contingent on the particular asset prices. 

These three data sources give rise to three types of volatility measures for this asset:
* Volatility as the conditional standard deviation of daily returns. This is the usual definition of volatility and is the focus of the volatility models that is discussed here.
* Implied volatility: Deducing the volatility of the share price based on option prices. This volatility measure tends to be larger than the conditional standard deviation of daily returns. 
* Realized volatility: Use of intra-day return sto estimate the daily volatility. This volatility measure has been subject of intensive research over the last few years.
