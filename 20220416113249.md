# Thought on Assembly vs C
Been reading *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective* during the last few days (reached p 235).
Currently the book is revolving around reading and understanding the Assembly code generated from C source code by the GCC C compiler.
One of the things that spring to mind when thinking about what great things C gets us is that we do not have to explicitely move data in and out of registers.
This, is what much of the code in Assembly is used for.
The fact that this is not necessary in C, makes C so much faster to write. 
There might be a downside to it however.
When we are writing C or any other high-level langauge we are not exposed to the fact that moving data in and out of registers is one of the most time-consuming things a CPU does.
This, quickly becomes apparent when looking at Assembly code, but not so in the C source code.
