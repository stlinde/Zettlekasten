# Peter Norvig - pytudes
Peter Norvig (author of *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*) has a GitHub page containing **pytudes**, that is short Python programs for perfecting particular programming skills.
He writes:
> There are plenty of other tutorials that will tell you how to do various things for various programming tasks - this one won't help. But if you think of programming like playing a piano - a craft that can take years to perfect - then I hope this collection can help.

Some examples of the programs in the repo:
* Advent of Code
* Cryptarithmetic
* Soduko: 100,000 puzzles/second in Java. 
* A Concrete Introduction to Probability
* lispy.py: Even better Lisp interpreter written in Python.
