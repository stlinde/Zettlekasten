# Using Neural Networks for HAR model specification
A lot of work have gone into specification of the number and length of lags in the HAR models.
MAHAR, H-MAHAR and many other versions of model averaging HAR models have been developed.
A possibility could be creating a custom loss function based on the OLS regression of a HAR model to evaluate the various specifications.
