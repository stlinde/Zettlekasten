# What is REST?

## REpresentational State Transfer
REST is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.
REST-compliant systems are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the conerns of client and server. 

## Separation of Client and Server
In the REST architectural style, the implementation of the client and the implementation of the server can be done independently without knowing about each other.
This means that the code on the client side can be changed at any time wihtout influencing the operation of the server, and vice versa.

This improve the flexibility of the interface across platforms and improve the scalability by simplifying the server components.
This also allows each component the ability to evolve independently.

## Statelessness
The statelessness of RESTful systems is enforced through the use of resources, rather than commands.
Resources are the nouns of the Web - they describe any object, document, or thing that you may need to store or send to other services.

## Communication between Client and Server
In the REST architecture, clients send requests to retrieve or modify resources, and servers send responses to these requests.

### Making Requests
A request generally consists of:
* An HTTP verb, which defines what kind of operation to perform.
* A header, which allows the client to pass along information about the request.
* A path to a resource
* An optional message body containing data.

There are four basic HTTP verbs we use in requests to interact with resources in a REST system.
* `GET` - retrieve a specific resource (by id) or a collection of resources.
* `POST` - create a new resource.
* `PUT` - update a specific resource (by id).
* `DELETE` - remove a specific resource by id.

Think CRUD.

In the header of the request, the client sends the type of content that it is able to receive fromthe server. 
This is called the `Accept` field, and it ensures that the server does not send data that cannot be understood or processed by the client.
The options for types of content are MIME Types (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions).

MIME Types consist of a `type` and a `subtype`, separated by `/`. 
Commmonly used types and subtypes are:
* `text/html`
* `text/css`
* `text/plain`
* `image` - ` image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`
* `audio` - `audio/wav`, `audio/mpeg`
* `video` - `video/mp4`, `video/ogg`
* `application` - `application/json`, `application/pdf`, `application/xml`, `application/octet-stream`.

Requests ust contain a path to a resource that the operation should be performed on.
In RESTful APIs, the paths should be designed to help the client know what is going on.
Paths should contain the information necessary to locate a resource with the degreee of specificity needed.

### Sending Responses
In cases where the server is sending a data payload to the client, the server must include a `content-type` in the header of the response. 
This `content-type` header fields alert the client to the type of data it is sending in the response body. 
These content types are MIME Types, just as they are in the `accept` field of the request header.
The `content-type` that the servers sends back should be one of the options that the client specified in the `accept` field of the request.

Responeses from the server contain status codes to alert the client server to information about the success of the operation.
The most common ones are:
* `200 (OK)` - This is the standard response for successfull HTTP requests.
* `201 (CREATED)` - This is the standard response for an HTTP request that resulted in an item being successfully created.
* `204 (NO CONTENT)` - This is the standard response for successful HTTP requests, where nothing is being returned in the response body.
* `400 (BAD REQUEST)` - The request cannot be processed due to bad request syntax, excessive size, or another client error.
* `403 (FORBIDDEN)` - The client does not have permission to access the resource.
* `404 (NOT FOUND)` - The resource could not be found at this time. It is possible it was deleted, or does not exist at all.
* `500 (INTERNAL SERVER ERROR)` - The generic answer for an unexpected failure if there is no more specific information available.
